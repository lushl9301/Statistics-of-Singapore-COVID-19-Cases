 Taskforce ramps up precautionary measures
 11. The Taskforce set up to direct a whole-of-government response to the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak met this afternoon. It has decided to step up Singapore’s overall preventive posture, given the expected inflow of visitors during the festive season and in view of the confirmed case. This would include expanding our border controls, to include land and sea checkpoints.
 12. Singapore will also expand our travel advisory to recommend that Singaporeans avoid travel to the whole of Hubei Province, in view of the travel restrictions that China has imposed on Huanggang and Ezhou. MOH also advises Singaporeans to continue to exercise caution and attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China.

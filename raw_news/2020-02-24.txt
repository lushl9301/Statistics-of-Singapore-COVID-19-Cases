 Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases

 10. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

 11. As of 24 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 2,842 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 856 are currently quarantined, and 1,986 have completed their quarantine.

 Health advisory
 12. Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China, and Daegu city and Cheongdo county in the Republic of Korea. MOH also reminds the public to continue to exercise caution when travelling to the rest of the Republic of Korea.

 13. All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.

 14. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:
 * Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
 * Observe good personal hygiene;
 * Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
 * Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
 * Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
 * Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

 15. MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.

12 Apr 2020
 32 more cases^[i] of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 560 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
 2. As of 12 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 233 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

 a) Imported cases: 0
 b) Linked to known clusters: 51
 c) Linked to other cases: 15
 d) Pending contact tracing: 167, of which 16 are Singapore Citizens/ Permanent Residents and 10 are Work Pass or Long Term Pass holders residing in our community; and 141 are Work Permit holders, mostly residing in dormitories, work sites and other living quarters.


 3. We have provided a breakdown of the trend of daily cases based on the different transmission types (see [47]Annex A). As seen from the chart, the number of imported cases rose around mid-March due to the large number of returnees but has since come down to zero. The number of cases in the community increased following the wave of new imported cases, but there has been some moderation in recent days, in light of the safe-distancing measures that have been put in place earlier. The number of work permit and dormitory-related cases has also increased sharply, and this is likely to continue going up, especially as we undertake more aggressive testing at the dormitories.
 4. Contact tracing and investigation are underway for currently unlinked cases to establish any links to known clusters or previous cases. In the past week (5 April to 11 April), MOH has uncovered links for 229 previously unlinked cases.

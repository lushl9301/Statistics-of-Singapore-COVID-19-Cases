 About the cases

 Case 16

 3. The 16^th confirmed case was announced on 31 January. The case is a 38 year-old male Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on 22 January. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).

 4. The case reported that he was asymptomatic during his flight to Singapore. He subsequently developed symptoms on 23 January and reported that he had stayed at his home at Nathan Road until 29 January, when he took a taxi to SGH. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on 31 January at about 2pm.

 Case 17

 5. The 17^th case is a 47 year-old female Singapore Citizen who travelled to Wuhan. She was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on 30 January, and arrived in Singapore on the same day. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight. Upon arrival at Changi Airport, she was found to have a fever during medical screening, and was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). She was tested positive for 2019-nCoV infection on 31 January at about 11pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID.

 Case 18

 6. The 18^th case is a 31 year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on 22 January. She was tested positive for 2019-nCoV infection on 1 February at about 2pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID.

 7. MOH has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases.

 Update on condition of confirmed cases

 8. The two new cases are stable currently, and we are continuing to monitor their health. As for the 16 previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving.

 Update on suspect cases

 9. As of 1 February, 12pm, 231 of the suspect cases have tested negative for 2019-nCoV, and 18 have tested positive (case 18 was confirmed at about 2pm, 1 February). Test results for the remaining 25 cases are pending.

 Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases

 10. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

 11. As of 1 February, 12pm, MOH has identified 245 close contacts. Of the 177 who are still in Singapore, 172 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining five close contacts.

 Health advisory
 12. Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.

 13. All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.

 14. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:
 * Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats;
 * Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
 * Observe good personal hygiene;
 * Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
 * Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
 * Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
 * Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

 15. MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated.

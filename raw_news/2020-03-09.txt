 Prioritisation of resources at public hospitals
 6. In view of the rising number of COVID-19 infections globally, and the expected rise in the number of confirmed cases in Singapore, we will need to prioritise the resources at our public hospitals.
 7. From 7 March 2020, foreigners who are short-term visit pass holders (STVP) who seek treatment for COVID-19 in Singapore will need to pay for their treatment. MOH will continue to waive COVID-19 testing fees for all STVP holders as part of our public health measures to identify and initiate contact tracing for confirmed cases who may have been infectious while in Singapore.
 8. The government will continue to pay for the COVID-19 testing fees and hospital bill in full for Singapore Residents and long term pass holders who are admitted to public hospitals for COVID-19.

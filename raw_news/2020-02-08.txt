8 Feb 2020
 As of 8 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed seven additional cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Singapore. Of these, five are linked to previously announced cases.
 2. Among the new confirmed cases are a taxi driver and a private hire car driver. MOH will continue to work with the Ministry of Transport to reach out to all taxi and private hire car drivers on the steps they should take to protect themselves in the course of their work. For the general public, the risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low.
 Links between previous cases found
 3. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
 a) Cases 8 and 9[47]^[1], as well as Cases 31, 33 and 38, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). This is a possible cluster involving five cases (Cases 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38).
 b) Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to the cluster associated with Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).
 c) Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22 January.
 Investigations on these clusters are ongoing.
 4. Contact tracing is underway for the other four locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China.

 * Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
 * Observe good personal hygiene;
 * Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
 * Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
 * Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and

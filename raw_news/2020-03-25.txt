 • The 38 imported cases^1 had travel history to Europe, North America, ASEAN and other parts of Asia. All except one were returning residents and Long Term Pass holders.

 • Eight cases^3 are currently unlinked, and contact tracing is ongoing.

The SHN requirements will be strictly enforced so as to reduce the risk of community transmission from imported cases.

 4. The case reported that she was asymptomatic during her flight to Singapore. She was identified as a close contact of the fourth confirmed case and had been quarantined from 26 January. She developed symptoms on 27 January, and was admitted to NCID. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on 29 January at about 11pm.
 Case 12
 5. The 12^th confirmed case is a 37 year-old female Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with her family on 22 January. She is currently warded in an isolation room at the NCID.
 6. The case reported that she was asymptomatic during her flight to Singapore. She subsequently developed symptoms on 26 January. She took a taxi to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 29 January, and was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated at NCID. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on 29 January at about 11pm.
 7. Prior to hospital admission, the case stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa (10 Artillery Avenue), Hotel 81 Princess (21 Lorong 12 Geylang) and Home Suite View Hotel (12 Lorong 12 Geylang). She indicated that she had visited Orchard Road and Geylang, and had travelled by taxi. The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low.
 Case 13
 8. The 13^th confirmed case is a 73 year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan with her family on 21 January. She was tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on 30 January at about 2pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID and her condition is stable.
 9. MOH has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases.
 Update on condition of confirmed cases
 10. The three new cases are stable currently, and we are continuing to monitor their health. As for the ten previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving.
 Update on suspect cases
 11. As of 30 January, 12pm, 164 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and 13 have tested positive (case 13 was confirmed at about 2pm, 30 January). Test results for the remaining 49 cases are pending.
 Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases
 12. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.
 13. As of 30 January, 12pm, MOH has identified 170 close contacts. Of the 139 who are still in Singapore, 135 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining four close contacts.
 Health advisory
 14. Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.
 15. All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.
 16. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:
 · Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats;
 · Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
 · Observe good personal hygiene;
 · Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
 · Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
 · Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
 · Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.
 17. MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster.

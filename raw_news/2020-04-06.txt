 PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Fengshan

 4. Further epidemiological investigations have uncovered a link between the PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Fengshan Blk 126 cluster to a family member of Case 601. The cluster, with 27 confirmed cases^[5],^ consisted of a family cluster of 11 cases^[6] who are family members of Case 601. With the assistance of the Singapore Police Force, our investigations revealed that Case 566 had travelled to Malaysia on 4 March and was likely infected there. She subsequently transmitted the infection to other family members, including Case 601. The rest of the affected staff members of the preschool likely became infected by Case 601 through a staff meeting.

 5. Among the 66 cases announced yesterday that were pending contact tracing, our investigations have established links for 22 of the cases, and further investigations are ongoing.

 6. Contact tracing is underway for unlinked cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions.

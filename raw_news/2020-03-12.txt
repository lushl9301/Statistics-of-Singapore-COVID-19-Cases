 As of 12 March 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified nine more cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. Of these:

 • Five are imported cases (Cases 180, 181, 182, 183 and 187); and

 2. The World Health Organization had on 11 March 2020 declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, in view of the rising number of cases reported around the world. Singapore has been planning ahead, and we have been progressively putting in place a suite of measures in preparation for a possible escalation of the situation, both locally and globally. The situation in Singapore remains under control, and we are not changing the DORSCON level.

 3. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.

Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.

 46. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:

 • Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
 • Observe good personal hygiene;
 • Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
 • Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
 • Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
 • Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

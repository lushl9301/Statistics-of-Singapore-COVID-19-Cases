As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

 Health advisory
 17. Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.
 18. All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.
 19. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:
 · Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
 · Observe good personal hygiene;
 · Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
 · Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
 · Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
 · Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.
 20. MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
